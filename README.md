This repository contains all of the source code needed to run Fix That Note!

Fix That Note! is a E155 class project. The class, focusing on microprocessors like FPGAs and MCUs challenges students at the end to ideate, create, and debug their own unique system.

Our team chose to create a system which reads in audio inputs via a microphone and amplifier circuit, then display out the dominant frequency via an LCD screen. It does this using an FFT function in the MCU, built using the CMSIS DSP library. It uses a custom LCD driver built into the FPGA.
